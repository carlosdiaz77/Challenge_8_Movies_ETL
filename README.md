# Module 8 Challenge, Movies ETL, Amazing Prime

## 1. Overview of the analysis

This is the challenge activity for the module 8 of the Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp of the university of Texas at Austin.
The main idea is to apply the learned skills of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

This project takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. 
I created one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL databas

## 2. Results:

This assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database



## 3. Summary: 

Using your knowledge of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring,  I was able to exract the data, transform it  and later be load it to Postgresql
